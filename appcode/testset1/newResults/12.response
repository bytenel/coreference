SEATTLE @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='5' REF='X17'>National Transportation Safety Board</COREF> is borrowing <COREF ID='6' REF='X8'>a Boeing 737</COREF> from Seattle's Museum of <COREF ID='X21'>Flight</COREF> as <COREF ID='X20'>part</COREF> of <COREF ID='9' REF='X17'>its investigation</COREF> into why a similar jetliner crashed near <COREF ID='X23'>Pittsburgh</COREF>
in 1994. <COREF ID='11' REF='X20'>The museum's aircraft</COREF> , ironically enough, was donated by USAir,
which operated <COREF ID='13' REF='11'>the airplane that crashed</COREF> , killing 132 people on
board. <COREF ID='14' REF='5'>The board</COREF> is testing the plane's rudder controls to learn why <COREF ID='16' REF='X21'>Flight 427</COREF> suddenly rolled and crashed while on <COREF ID='17' REF='9'>its</COREF> approach to the <COREF ID='18' REF='X23'>Pittsburgh</COREF> airport Sept. 8, 1994. <COREF ID='X51'>Aviation safety investigators</COREF> say
a sharp movement of the rudder @amp;MD; <COREF ID='19' REF='11'>the movable vertical piece in the plane's tail</COREF> @amp;MD; could have caused <COREF ID='21' REF='11'>the jet</COREF> 's deadly roll.
<COREF ID='X70'>NTSB Chairman Jim Hall</COREF> is to address <COREF ID='X67'>a briefing</COREF> on the <COREF ID='23' REF='9'>investigation</COREF> in <COREF ID='24' REF='X17'>Seattle</COREF> Thursday, but <COREF ID='X71'>board spokesman Mike Benson</COREF>
said <COREF ID='26' REF='X70'>Hall</COREF> isn't expected to announce any findings. <COREF ID='27' REF='X71'>Benson</COREF> said <COREF ID='28' REF='X51'>investigators</COREF> are simulating air loads on <COREF ID='29' REF='11'>the 737's rudder</COREF> . ``It's a slow, methodical job since <COREF ID='31' REF='X67'>we</COREF> don't have adequate
black boxes,'' <COREF ID='32' REF='11'>he</COREF> said.
Newer models of flight data recorders, or ``black boxes,'' would
record the angle of the rudder and the pedal controlling it. But
because <COREF ID='37' REF='11'>the plane</COREF> was reduced to debris by the force of <COREF ID='38' REF='2'>the crash</COREF> ,
and <COREF ID='39' REF='X8'>the 737</COREF> was equipped with older-model flight recorders <COREF ID='X100'>that</COREF>
didn't measure <COREF ID='40' REF='X100'>such information</COREF> , <COREF ID='41' REF='X51'>investigators</COREF> are running tests to
``surmise'' <COREF ID='42' REF='29'>rudder and pedal position</COREF> , <COREF ID='43' REF='X71'>Benson</COREF> said.
Installation of <COREF ID='44' REF='X21'>improved flight recorders</COREF> was an official
recommendation of <COREF ID='45' REF='5'>the board</COREF> after earlier hearings into the <COREF ID='46' REF='2'>Pittsburgh crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='48' REF='X21'>Museum of Flight</COREF> spokesman Bill Hayes said <COREF ID='49' REF='11'>the plane</COREF> , donated
last September, was to be partially dismantled as an exhibit. The <COREF ID='50' REF='1'>NTSB</COREF> was looking for <COREF ID='51' REF='6'>an intact plane on which to conduct tests</COREF> , so <COREF ID='53' REF='11'>the museum</COREF> delayed <COREF ID='54' REF='9'>its</COREF> plans. <COREF ID='55' REF='11'>The tests</COREF> are being conducted at a Boeing hangar at Boeing
Field. <COREF ID='X139'>No airborne tests</COREF> are planned.
The <COREF ID='57' REF='1'>NTSB</COREF> also conducted tests <COREF ID='58' REF='X139'>last September</COREF> to determine if
wake turbulence from <COREF ID='X146'>another plane</COREF> could have contributed to <COREF ID='59' REF='2'>the crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='60' REF='X71'>Benson</COREF> said those results are still being analyzed.

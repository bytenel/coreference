NAVY GROUNDS <COREF ID='2' REF='X7'>F-14'S</COREF> AFTER THIRD <COREF ID='X11'>RECENT CRASH</COREF>

WASHINGTON @amp;MD; <COREF ID='X23'>The <COREF ID='3' REF='X23'>Navy</COREF> suspended operations</COREF> for <COREF ID='4' REF='3'>its</COREF> entire fleet
of <COREF ID='X32'>F-14 airplanes</COREF> <COREF ID='X29'>Thursday</COREF> after <COREF ID='6' REF='X11'>the third ``Tomcat'' crash in a month</COREF> @amp;MD; <COREF ID='8' REF='X23'>the second in a week</COREF> .
The 72-hour ``safety stand-down'' came shortly after an F-14
<COREF ID='X41'>fighter</COREF> from <COREF ID='X40'>the</COREF> USS Nimitz crashed during flight operations in the
northern Persian Gulf at about 6:30 a.m. EST.
The <COREF ID='10' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> announced that the two Naval aviators on board were
rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after <COREF ID='11' REF='X40'>they</COREF> ejected from <COREF ID='12' REF='X40'>the aircraft</COREF> .
The <COREF ID='13' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> said that <COREF ID='14' REF='11'>both men</COREF> were in good condition. One aviator
suffered minor abrasions. The <COREF ID='15' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> is investigating the cause.
Another Tomcat crashed off the coast of California during
exercises on <COREF ID='X72'>the aircraft carrier</COREF> Carl Vinson on Sunday. Both crew
members were killed. Late last month, an F-14 crashed near
Nashville, killing both crew members and three civilians on the
ground.
Although <COREF ID='16' REF='X11'>the crash</COREF> <COREF ID='17' REF='X29'>Thursday</COREF> was <COREF ID='18' REF='X11'>the third Tomcat crash</COREF> <COREF ID='X87'>this</COREF>
year, <COREF ID='X94'>Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon</COREF> said the <COREF ID='22' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> had
uncovered no evidence of a flaw in <COREF ID='23' REF='12'>the aircraft</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X104'>A safety stand-down</COREF> is <COREF ID='24' REF='X14'>a procedure the military uses to conduct an intensive review</COREF> . During <COREF ID='25' REF='X87'>this three-day period</COREF> , the three
classes of <COREF ID='27' REF='2'>F-14s</COREF> will stay out of the air so <COREF ID='28' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> personnel can
review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each
aircraft for weaknesses or deficiencies.
The F-14s on the deck of the USS America will be allowed to fly
off because <COREF ID='29' REF='12'>the aircraft carrier</COREF> is returning from a deployment.
Carrier decks are routinely cleared of aircraft the day before the <COREF ID='30' REF='X72'>carrier</COREF> docks.
``We do not know what has caused <COREF ID='X138'>these three crashes</COREF> <COREF ID='X137'>this</COREF>
year,'' <COREF ID='33' REF='X94'>Bacon</COREF> said. ``The goal of <COREF ID='34' REF='X104'>the stand-down</COREF> is to take a time
out to look at everything involved with <COREF ID='35' REF='2'>the F-14s</COREF> .
Adm. Jeremy Boorda, <COREF ID='36' REF='X23'>the chief of Naval Operations</COREF> , informed
Deputy Defense Secretary John White of <COREF ID='38' REF='X11'>the latest crash</COREF> <COREF ID='39' REF='X29'>Thursday</COREF>
morning and told <COREF ID='40' REF='X137'>him</COREF> <COREF ID='41' REF='X137'>he</COREF> was ordering <COREF ID='42' REF='X104'>the standdown</COREF> for <COREF ID='43' REF='12'>the entire fleet of more than 300 aircraft</COREF> , <COREF ID='45' REF='X94'>Bacon</COREF> said.
``What the <COREF ID='46' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> is trying to do is find out what caused <COREF ID='47' REF='X138'>these accidents</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='48' REF='X94'>Bacon</COREF> said.
In the past five years, 32 F-14s have crashed. One of the
Navy's first female pilots, <COREF ID='50' REF='11'>Lt. Kara Hultgren</COREF> , died while trying to
land an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in 1994. The <COREF ID='51' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> concluded
that engine failure caused that crash. <COREF ID='52' REF='X19'>The Tomcat</COREF> , <COREF ID='53' REF='12'>a $38 million, twin-engine aircraft</COREF> built by the
Grumman Aerospace Corp., is <COREF ID='54' REF='X41'>the standard fighter plane</COREF> used by the
Navy for close-in air combat. <COREF ID='56' REF='X19'>The aircraft</COREF> has been in operation
since 1973. The oldest version of the aircraft, <COREF ID='58' REF='X32'>the F-14A</COREF> , is
scheduled to be phased out by the year 2004.
The crash rate for <COREF ID='59' REF='X32'>the F-14</COREF> dropped dramatically after the
initial years of deployment and has generally gone down since <COREF ID='60' REF='X19'>then</COREF>
except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval
records. <COREF ID='61' REF='X94'>Bacon</COREF> said the <COREF ID='62' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> had no single explanation for the increases
in <COREF ID='63' REF='X32'>F-14</COREF> accidents.
``The <COREF ID='64' REF='3'>Navy</COREF> informs <COREF ID='65' REF='X137'>me</COREF> that <COREF ID='66' REF='X40'>they</COREF> have been unable to find a
common thread to <COREF ID='67' REF='X138'>these accidents</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='68' REF='X94'>Bacon</COREF> said. ``This is <COREF ID='69' REF='66'>a mystery</COREF> .''

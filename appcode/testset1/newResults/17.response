HALF MOON BAY, Calif. <COREF ID='6' REF='2'>Joe Reid</COREF> , who died Thursday when <COREF ID='X22'>the</COREF>
airplane <COREF ID='53' REF='X22'>he</COREF> was flying with <COREF ID='X30'>7-year-old Jessica Dubroff</COREF> and <COREF ID='X28'>her</COREF>
father crashed in Cheyenne, Wyo., took up flying the same way <COREF ID='10' REF='X28'>he</COREF>
did anything else: with <COREF ID='X39'>passion and attention</COREF> to detail.
``I respected <COREF ID='11'>his</COREF> leadership, <COREF ID='12'>his</COREF> thoroughness,'' said <COREF ID='X41'>Gary</COREF>
Petersen, <COREF ID='13' REF='X41'>manager</COREF> of Half Moon Bay Airport. `` <COREF ID='15' REF='X41'>He</COREF> was always capable
and competent, <COREF ID='16' REF='13'>a real by-the-book guy</COREF> @amp;MD; very thorough, <COREF ID='X53'>very</COREF>
detailed.'' <COREF ID='17' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> , 52, who for nearly 27 years was <COREF ID='18' REF='X53'>a broker at the Dean Witter Reynolds office in Palo Alto</COREF> , was <COREF ID='19' REF='X13'>president of the Half Moon Bay Pilots Association</COREF> .
George Auld, <COREF ID='20' REF='17'>a longtime friend</COREF> who co-owned the aircraft <COREF ID='X72'>that</COREF>
crashed, said <COREF ID='22' REF='X72'>he</COREF> had first taken <COREF ID='23' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> up in <COREF ID='X85'>a small plane</COREF> in 1970. <COREF ID='24' REF='X72'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='25' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> , <COREF ID='26' REF='X72'>a Vietnam veteran</COREF> , got <COREF ID='27'>his</COREF> pilot's license in <COREF ID='X80'>the</COREF>
late 1970s and was certified to be <COREF ID='28' REF='X80'>an instructor</COREF> about four years
ago.
<COREF ID='X96'>They</COREF> bought <COREF ID='29' REF='X85'>the plane</COREF> , <COREF ID='30' REF='29'>a 1975 single-engine Cessna 177B Cardinal</COREF> , about nine years ago.
`` <COREF ID='31' REF='X96'>He</COREF> loved <COREF ID='32' REF='X96'>flying</COREF> and helping <COREF ID='X102'>other people</COREF> learn the excitement
of <COREF ID='33' REF='32'>flying</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='34' REF='X102'>Auld</COREF> said. `` <COREF ID='35' REF='4'>Joe</COREF> 's not the type to do anything half
way.'' <COREF ID='36' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> began giving lessons to <COREF ID='37' REF='X30'>Jessica</COREF> about five months ago and
was supportive of <COREF ID='38' REF='36'>her</COREF> effort to become the youngest person ever to
make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the United States.
`` <COREF ID='39'>I</COREF> 'm teaching <COREF ID='40'>her</COREF> just like <COREF ID='41'>I</COREF> would anybody else,'' <COREF ID='42'>he</COREF> said.
``Mentally, <COREF ID='43' REF='39'>she</COREF> grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''
Forrest Storz, who also gives <COREF ID='44' REF='32'>flying</COREF> lessons at the airport,
called <COREF ID='46' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> <COREF ID='47' REF='44'>``an exceptional, competent pilot.''</COREF> <COREF ID='48' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> , who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and was graduated from
Saint Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kan., was active in
<COREF ID='X149'>the</COREF> <COREF ID='49' REF='19'>Half Moon Bay</COREF> community and serving a fourth term on the
Coastside County Water District board. <COREF ID='50' REF='X149'>He</COREF> also was <COREF ID='51' REF='X21'>a member of the San Mateo County Airport Land Use Committee</COREF> and was <COREF ID='52' REF='X39'>chairman of the annual Half Moon Bay Fly-In and Air Show</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X162'>He</COREF> and his wife, Ana, were <COREF ID='57'>active parishioners</COREF> at Our Lady of
the Pillar Catholic Church. <COREF ID='58' REF='X162'>They</COREF> had two sons, Christopher, 27, of
Occidental, and Matthew, 23, of Half Moon Bay.

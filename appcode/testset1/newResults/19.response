Providence, Rhode Island, <COREF ID='9'>April 24</COREF> ( <COREF ID='10' REF='X18'>Bloomberg</COREF> ) -- <COREF ID='11' REF='1'>Textron Inc.</COREF>
is discussing <COREF ID='12' REF='9'>the sale</COREF> of <COREF ID='X29'>its Paul Revere Corp. disability</COREF>
<COREF ID='X31'>insurance unit</COREF> to Provident Cos. Inc. for about $1 billion, a
person familiar with <COREF ID='17'>the talks</COREF> said. <COREF ID='18'>The talks</COREF> are part of <COREF ID='19' REF='1'>Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron</COREF> 's
efforts to shed <COREF ID='X45'>financial services units</COREF> and focus on core
manufacturing businesses, which include making Cessna aircraft,
Bell helicopters and E-Z-GO golf carts.
For <COREF ID='22' REF='2'>Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Provident</COREF> , an acquisition would
be <COREF ID='23' REF='X11'>the latest step in the company's effort to reorganize and expand</COREF>
through insuring policyholders against loss of income if <COREF ID='24'>they</COREF>
suffer a debilitating accident or illness.
<COREF ID='X66'>Textron Chief Financial Officer Stephen Key</COREF> declined to comment
on <COREF ID='X69'>the likelihood</COREF> of selling Paul Revere. <COREF ID='27' REF='X66'>His company</COREF> ``has been
saying all along'' that <COREF ID='29' REF='X69'>it</COREF> plans to reduce <COREF ID='30' REF='X29'>its</COREF> presence in <COREF ID='31' REF='X45'>financial services</COREF> , <COREF ID='32' REF='X69'>he</COREF> said, declining to elaborate. <COREF ID='33' REF='2'>Provident</COREF> wouldn't comment on any potential acquisitions. <COREF ID='34' REF='2'>Provident</COREF> Vice President Thomas White said, `` <COREF ID='35' REF='X69'>We</COREF> have said it is <COREF ID='36'>our</COREF> strategy to grow <COREF ID='37' REF='2'>Provident</COREF> .''
News of <COREF ID='38' REF='17'>the talks</COREF> was reported in <COREF ID='39' REF='29'>today</COREF> 's Wall Street Journal. <COREF ID='40' REF='2'>Provident</COREF> stock fell 1/8 to 30 7/8 in early trading. <COREF ID='41' REF='1'>Textron</COREF> shares
rose 3/4 to 88 7/8.
Officials at <COREF ID='42' REF='X11'>Paul Revere</COREF> weren't available for comment. <COREF ID='43' REF='X29'>Its</COREF>
shares rose 3/4 to 25.
Worcester, Massachusetts-based <COREF ID='44' REF='X11'>Paul Revere</COREF> , 83 percent owned by <COREF ID='80' REF='1'>Textron</COREF> , has been <COREF ID='47' REF='X11'>a laggard among Textron's six operating units</COREF> ,
and especially among <COREF ID='49' REF='X29'>its</COREF> finance-oriented businesses. In 1995,
revenue at <COREF ID='50' REF='X11'>Paul Revere</COREF> rose 14 percent to <COREF ID='51'>$1.52 billion</COREF> <COREF ID='X112'>while</COREF>
operating income dropped 6 percent to <COREF ID='52' REF='X112'>$123 million</COREF> . Revenue also
rose as income declined in 1994.
While <COREF ID='53' REF='X11'>Paul Revere</COREF> has had trouble with rising benefit costs,
results are just the opposite at Textron's Avco Financial Services
unit, <COREF ID='55' REF='27'>a consumer finance company</COREF> , and Textron Financial Corp., <COREF ID='56' REF='27'>a commercial finance company.</COREF>
Revenue in Avco and Textron Financial rose 19 percent <COREF ID='59' REF='55'>last year</COREF>
on a combined basis to <COREF ID='60' REF='51'>$1.99 billion</COREF> , with operating income
increasing 10 percent to <COREF ID='61' REF='52'>$365 million</COREF> .
Given <COREF ID='X152'>the performance</COREF> at <COREF ID='62' REF='X11'>Paul Revere</COREF> , Salomon Brothers analyst
George Shapiro said <COREF ID='63' REF='1'>Textron</COREF> has been looking ``to extricate'' <COREF ID='64' REF='X152'>itself</COREF> from <COREF ID='65' REF='X31'>the insurance company</COREF> in <COREF ID='X156'>favor</COREF> of acquiring more <COREF ID='66'>manufacturing businesses</COREF> .

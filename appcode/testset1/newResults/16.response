By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau <COREF ID='5' REF='X10'>Two Chinese crew members</COREF>
were killed Tuesday when <COREF ID='X26'>their helicopter</COREF> crashed near <COREF ID='8' REF='5'>Macau</COREF> .
The China Southern Helicopter Company <COREF ID='9' REF='5'>aircraft</COREF> was on <COREF ID='10' REF='9'>its</COREF> way to
Zhuhai, apparently returning from an oil rig, when <COREF ID='11' REF='10'>it</COREF> crashed, said
a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.
Other reports said <COREF ID='13' REF='X26'>the helicopter</COREF> , which went down 10 to 15
<COREF ID='X41'>nautical miles</COREF> southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information. <COREF ID='14' REF='X41'>The incident</COREF> fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering <COREF ID='X44'>a search</COREF>
by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.
<COREF ID='X51'>Two Government Flying Service helicopters</COREF> joined <COREF ID='16' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> Marine
Police in <COREF ID='17' REF='X44'>the search</COREF> for <COREF ID='18' REF='X51'>the Sikorsky 76</COREF> . <COREF ID='19' REF='X51'>Mainland</COREF> authorities later told <COREF ID='20' REF='X51'>the department</COREF> 's Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from
<COREF ID='X62'>the Chinese island</COREF> of <COREF ID='21' REF='X51'>Daiwaishan</COREF> .
``Someone on <COREF ID='22' REF='X62'>the island</COREF> heard a noise and called <COREF ID='23' REF='X51'>Zhuhai</COREF> airport
authorities,'' said <COREF ID='X69'>a</COREF> <COREF ID='24' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> aviation source. `` <COREF ID='25' REF='2'>China</COREF> sent a
helicopter and confirmed <COREF ID='26' REF='40'>the crash</COREF> on <COREF ID='27' REF='X62'>the island</COREF> .'' <COREF ID='28' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said <COREF ID='29' REF='27'>the pilots</COREF> had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''. <COREF ID='30' REF='23'>Zhuhai</COREF> officials confirmed <COREF ID='31' REF='5'>the crew</COREF> had been killed.
Sources suggested that poor weather was <COREF ID='32' REF='40'>the likely cause of the crash</COREF> .
The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at <COREF ID='34' REF='29'>the time</COREF> . Rescuers also reported poor visibility. <COREF ID='35' REF='2'>China</COREF> , as <COREF ID='36' REF='X69'>the country of registration</COREF> , would investigate <COREF ID='37' REF='14'>the incident</COREF> , the <COREF ID='38' REF='20'>Civil Aviation Department</COREF> said.

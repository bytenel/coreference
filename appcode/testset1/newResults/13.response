By PATRICIA YOUNG
c.1996 South China Morning Post <COREF ID='6' REF='1'>The Russian airline Aeroflot</COREF> has been hit with a writ for loss
and damages, filed in <COREF ID='X20'>Hong Kong</COREF> by <COREF ID='7' REF='2'>the families</COREF> of <COREF ID='X22'>seven passengers</COREF>
killed in an air crash.
<COREF ID='X28'>All 75 people</COREF> on board the Aeroflot Airbus died when <COREF ID='12' REF='X28'>it</COREF> ploughed
into a Siberian mountain in March 1994.
Aeroflot general manager for Hong Kong Vassili Tkatchenko said
on <COREF ID='X40'>Tuesday</COREF> <COREF ID='15' REF='X40'>he</COREF> was unaware <COREF ID='16' REF='6'>the writ</COREF> had been filed. <COREF ID='17' REF='6'>The writ</COREF> is for ``damages, interest and costs'' of seven
<COREF ID='X50'>passengers</COREF> who died when <COREF ID='19' REF='6'>the Moscow Airbus A310 flight</COREF> bound for <COREF ID='22' REF='X20'>Hong Kong</COREF> crashed at Novokuznetsk, Siberia. <COREF ID='23' REF='X50'>It</COREF> claims <COREF ID='24' REF='6'>the deaths</COREF> were ``caused by negligence, breach of
statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of <COREF ID='25' REF='6'>the defendant</COREF>
[ <COREF ID='26' REF='1'>Aeroflot</COREF> ].''
Air industry investigators say <COREF ID='X66'>the 15-year-old son</COREF> of Captain
<COREF ID='X70'>Yaroslav Kudrinsky</COREF> was flying <COREF ID='27' REF='6'>the Hong Kong-bound aircraft</COREF> after <COREF ID='29' REF='X70'>it</COREF>
left Moscow. Black box transcripts show <COREF ID='31' REF='31'>Eldar</COREF> and Yana, <COREF ID='32' REF='X66'>his 13-year-old sister</COREF> , were in the cockpit prior to the crash.
Airline passengers are protected under a section of the Warsaw
Convention relating to air travel which was signed on October 12,
1929.
The liability of the carrier for <COREF ID='X94'>death or personal injury</COREF> to <COREF ID='35' REF='X22'>passengers</COREF> has an upper limit of US$75,000. But larger amounts have
been awarded through the courts or through out-of-court
settlements.
Aviation consultant Steve Miller, <COREF ID='37' REF='6'>the managing director</COREF> of
Trinity Aviation, said <COREF ID='38' REF='37'>he</COREF> was unaware of any aviation court
settlements in <COREF ID='39' REF='X20'>Hong Kong</COREF> .
``Taking <COREF ID='40' REF='40'>it</COREF> to the courts is very unusual for <COREF ID='41' REF='X20'>Hong Kong</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='42' REF='X94'>Mr Miller</COREF> said.
Six of the claims in <COREF ID='43' REF='6'>the writs</COREF> were filed by <COREF ID='44' REF='X20'>family members who live outside Hong Kong</COREF> .

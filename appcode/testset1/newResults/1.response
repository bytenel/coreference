UK Government: <COREF ID='X1'>Another area</COREF> free from <COREF ID='X3'>classical swine fever</COREF>
------------------------------------------
.
A second infected <COREF ID='1' REF='X1'>area</COREF> in East Anglia was declared free from <COREF ID='2' REF='X3'>classical swine fever</COREF> ( <COREF ID='3' REF='3'>CSF</COREF> ) today and <COREF ID='X11'>the relevant Infected</COREF> Area Order has been
revoked.
Pigs can now be freely moved on and off <COREF ID='X19'>about 160 farms</COREF> previously in <COREF ID='4' REF='X1'>the Infected Area</COREF> imposed around <COREF ID='X21'>the Norfolk breeding unit</COREF> where <COREF ID='X18'>the outbreak</COREF>
is believed to have originated. <COREF ID='5' REF='X19'>It</COREF> had been confirmed as infected on <COREF ID='X23'>9</COREF>
August - the <COREF ID='6' REF='6'>second</COREF> of 15 premises to be confirmed with <COREF ID='7' REF='3'>CSF</COREF> following the
start of the <COREF ID='8' REF='X18'>outbreak</COREF> on <COREF ID='9' REF='X23'>8 Aug 2000</COREF> .
The infected area in north Essex was <COREF ID='10' REF='X11'>the first</COREF> to be pronounced clear of
<COREF ID='11' REF='X11'>the disease</COREF> , and movement restrictions lifted on more than 90 farms
<COREF ID='12' REF='X11'>there</COREF> , on 22 Sep 2000.
The decision to lift the infected <COREF ID='13' REF='X1'>area</COREF> was made following full veterinary
investigation. Similar investigations will be progressively undertaken in
<COREF ID='X62'>the other infected areas</COREF> with a view to lifting <COREF ID='14' REF='X62'>them</COREF> as soon as possible.
Notes for Editors
1. Farmers in the remaining infected <COREF ID='15' REF='X1'>areas</COREF> who have animal welfare
problems because of overstocking may apply for a licence to move <COREF ID='16' REF='16'>pigs</COREF>
within the same surveillance zone of an infected area, subject to strict
conditions. <COREF ID='17' REF='X11'>They</COREF> can also apply to send <COREF ID='18' REF='16'>pigs</COREF> to slaughter under the Pig
Disposal (Welfare) Scheme. Details of both options are available from the
Bury St Edmunds control center helpline on <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>08702 414215</COREF> . <COREF ID='20' REF='X19'>Farmers</COREF> in
infected <COREF ID='21' REF='X1'>areas</COREF> can also phone this <COREF ID='22' REF='22'>number</COREF> for general information
relating to the <COREF ID='23' REF='X18'>outbreak</COREF> of <COREF ID='24' REF='3'>CSF</COREF> .
2. <COREF ID='X107'>An EU ban</COREF> on the export of live <COREF ID='25' REF='16'>pigs</COREF> and <COREF ID='26' REF='16'>pig</COREF> semen from <COREF ID='27' REF='X21'>Norfolk</COREF> and
Suffolk remains in place until November 15. <COREF ID='28' REF='X107'>It</COREF> will be reconsidered at
the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee of <COREF ID='29' REF='X11'>the EU</COREF> .

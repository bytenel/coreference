WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='6' REF='1'>Navy</COREF> said Friday that <COREF ID='7' REF='2'>a pilot</COREF> was probably
showing off for <COREF ID='X30'>his parents</COREF> when <COREF ID='9' REF='X30'>he</COREF> crashed an F-14A jet fighter in
<COREF ID='X35'>Nashville</COREF> in January, killing <COREF ID='11' REF='X35'>himself</COREF> , a fellow officer and three
people on the ground. <COREF ID='12' REF='2'>The pilot</COREF> , <COREF ID='13' REF='13'>Lt. Comdr. John Stacy Bates</COREF> , had been grounded for a
month in <COREF ID='X49'>April 1995</COREF> after <COREF ID='14' REF='X49'>he</COREF> lost control of another F-14A after
taking off from the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln. <COREF ID='15' REF='9'>The plane</COREF> crashed
after <COREF ID='16' REF='2'>the pilot</COREF> and his crew ejected. <COREF ID='18' REF='9'>The crew members</COREF> were
rescued.
Rear Adm. Bernard Smith, who investigated <COREF ID='19' REF='3'>the Nashville crash</COREF> ,
said <COREF ID='21' REF='13'>Bates</COREF> ' judgment was influenced by <COREF ID='22' REF='X30'>his parents</COREF> ' <COREF ID='X69'>presence</COREF> at the
field'' and <COREF ID='24' REF='X69'>his</COREF> desire to show <COREF ID='25' REF='24'>them</COREF> risky takeoff and flight
maneuvers. <COREF ID='26' REF='9'>The admiral</COREF> said that in taking off from the <COREF ID='27' REF='X35'>Nashville</COREF> airport
on Jan. 29, <COREF ID='28' REF='13'>Bates</COREF> ascended at an angle steeper than 50 degrees,
violating <COREF ID='30' REF='1'>Navy</COREF> rules.
After the near-perpendicular takeoff, in the clouds, <COREF ID='31' REF='31'>Smith</COREF> said, <COREF ID='32' REF='2'>the pilot</COREF> became disoriented, and in <COREF ID='X89'>all likelihood</COREF> did not realize
that <COREF ID='33' REF='X89'>he</COREF> was heading earthward until <COREF ID='34' REF='33'>his</COREF> <COREF ID='53' REF='X15'>jet</COREF> pierced <COREF ID='35' REF='9'>the clouds</COREF> at 2,300 feet.
By <COREF ID='36' REF='9'>then</COREF> , <COREF ID='37' REF='9'>the admiral</COREF> said, <COREF ID='38' REF='36'>it</COREF> was <COREF ID='39' REF='39'>too late</COREF> to prevent <COREF ID='40' REF='9'>the plane</COREF> from smashing into the house of Elmer and Ada Newsom.
In <COREF ID='X107'>addition</COREF> to <COREF ID='41' REF='13'>Bates</COREF> , 33, and <COREF ID='42' REF='X30'>his radar intercept officer</COREF> , <COREF ID='44' REF='13'>Lt. Graham Alden Higgins</COREF> , 28, those killed were <COREF ID='45' REF='7'>the Newsoms and Ewing Wair</COREF> , who was visiting <COREF ID='47' REF='X107'>them</COREF> . <COREF ID='48' REF='3'>The crash</COREF> would never have happened had <COREF ID='49' REF='2'>the pilot</COREF> made a normal
take-off or taken the cloudy weather into account, <COREF ID='50' REF='31'>Smith</COREF> said after
an 11-week review of <COREF ID='51' REF='9'>the incident</COREF> .

WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='5' REF='X13'>U.S. Navy</COREF> ordered <COREF ID='X32'>all</COREF> of <COREF ID='6' REF='X13'>its F-14s</COREF> out of <COREF ID='X33'>the</COREF>
skies for <COREF ID='X44'>at least three days</COREF> after <COREF ID='80' REF='X33'>one of them</COREF> crashed on <COREF ID='X42'>Thursday</COREF>
in the Persian Gulf, <COREF ID='10' REF='X33'>the third crash</COREF> of an F-14 in the last month.
The two-man crew survived <COREF ID='11' REF='X33'>the crash</COREF> , ejecting into the northern
waters of <COREF ID='12' REF='X33'>the gulf</COREF> , and were rescued and returned to the carrier
Nimitz. <COREF ID='13' REF='X33'>The two crewmen</COREF> , who were not identified, were reported to have
suffered minor injuries.
The three-day shutdown of <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>the Navy's fleet of more than 330 F-14s</COREF> was ordered by the chief of naval operations, <COREF ID='18' REF='18'>Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda</COREF> , who said in an interview at the Pentagon that while there
was no immediate evidence of a connection among <COREF ID='19' REF='X33'>the three crashes</COREF> ,
``This is <COREF ID='20' REF='X44'>an airplane</COREF> that <COREF ID='21' REF='20'>we</COREF> worry about.''
`` <COREF ID='22' REF='X32'>A jinxed airplane</COREF> ?'' <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>he</COREF> said. ``No. But known deficiencies in
the earlier models? Yes, and <COREF ID='24' REF='21'>we</COREF> 're working on that, including some
<COREF ID='X100'>changes</COREF> to <COREF ID='25' REF='X33'>the aircraft</COREF> .'' <COREF ID='26' REF='X100'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='27' REF='X33'>the three-day review</COREF> might result in new restrictions on
use of <COREF ID='29' REF='X33'>the plane</COREF> , nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest
accident rate for jet fighters in the <COREF ID='31' REF='X13'>Navy</COREF> fleet. Ten F-14s have
gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991. Each plane
costs more than $30 million.
`` <COREF ID='32' REF='21'>We</COREF> may come out with some more operational restrictions, but
it's way too early to say that,'' <COREF ID='33' REF='X33'>the admiral</COREF> said. ``This is too
serious a business to be guessing about.''
Navy officials said that during <COREF ID='35' REF='X33'>the shutdown</COREF> , special engineers
and other safety experts would review the evidence available from <COREF ID='36' REF='X33'>the three recent crashes</COREF> and inspect the rest of <COREF ID='37' REF='X33'>the fleet</COREF> for
<COREF ID='X145'>defects</COREF> in <COREF ID='38' REF='X33'>the planes</COREF> , in <COREF ID='39' REF='X145'>their</COREF> maintenance, or in pilot training. <COREF ID='40' REF='X33'>Earlier models of the fighter</COREF> , called the F-14A, were plagued
with <COREF ID='X158'>engine problems</COREF> when <COREF ID='43' REF='X158'>they</COREF> entered the <COREF ID='44' REF='X13'>Navy</COREF> 's fleet of
carrier-based jet fighters in 1973. Specifically, the engines used
on <COREF ID='45' REF='X33'>the first model</COREF> were not powerful enough for <COREF ID='46' REF='X32'>a fighter</COREF> of <COREF ID='47' REF='X13'>its</COREF>
size.
The <COREF ID='48' REF='X13'>Navy</COREF> was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots
could operate <COREF ID='49' REF='X33'>the aircraft</COREF> , and had to replace many of <COREF ID='50' REF='X33'>the engines</COREF> .
Two of the three planes that have crashed since late January were <COREF ID='52' REF='X13'>F-14As</COREF> .
The engines installed in later models, <COREF ID='53' REF='X13'>the F-14B and the F-14D</COREF> ,
were more powerful and have proved more reliable. Despite the
troubles of <COREF ID='54' REF='X13'>the F-14 fleet</COREF> , the rate of accidents among all <COREF ID='55' REF='X13'>Navy</COREF>
fighter planes has come down dramatically in recent years, a record
that has made <COREF ID='56' REF='X33'>the recent spate of crashes</COREF> all the more alarming.
In the first of <COREF ID='57' REF='X19'>the crashes this year</COREF> , an F-14A crashed into a
residential neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 29, seconds
after takeoff. The two-man crew was killed, along with three people
on the ground. The pilot was involved in another <COREF ID='58' REF='X13'>F-14</COREF> crash in
1995.
Last Sunday, the crew of an F-14D was killed when <COREF ID='59' REF='X33'>the fighter</COREF>
plunged into the Pacific off the coast of Southern California
during exercises. <COREF ID='60' REF='X13'>The F-14</COREF> that crashed on <COREF ID='90' REF='X42'>Thursday</COREF> had flown from <COREF ID='62' REF='X33'>the Nimitz</COREF> ,
which is sailing in <COREF ID='63' REF='X33'>the Persian Gulf</COREF> to enforce a no-fly zone over
southern Iraq, an operation that dates from the end of the 1991 war
in <COREF ID='64' REF='X33'>the gulf</COREF> . <COREF ID='65' REF='X13'>Navy officials</COREF> said that <COREF ID='67' REF='X33'>the plane</COREF> was on a routine
training mission. <COREF ID='68' REF='X33'>They</COREF> would not speculate on the cause of <COREF ID='69' REF='X33'>the crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='70' REF='X33'>The plane</COREF> , which was manufacutred by the Grumman Corp. of Long
Island, has gone out of production, and the <COREF ID='71' REF='X13'>Navy</COREF> has begun to phase
out <COREF ID='72' REF='X33'>the plane</COREF> entirely, replacing <COREF ID='73' REF='72'>it</COREF> with the F-18.

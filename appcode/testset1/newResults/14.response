NEW PRESSURES ON <COREF ID='X11'>AIRLINE CRASH-LIABILITY ACCORD</COREF>

WASHINGTON @amp;MD; <COREF ID='7' REF='X15'>The Warsaw Convention</COREF> governing <COREF ID='8' REF='X11'>the liability of an airline when passengers die in a plane crash</COREF> is crumbling as
airlines try to raise <COREF ID='11' REF='X11'>the accord</COREF> 's $75,000 limit on damages.
But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the
<COREF ID='X36'>U.S. Department</COREF> of Transportation is demanding that <COREF ID='12' REF='X11'>the accord</COREF>
provide that damage suits involving <COREF ID='X39'>Americans</COREF> be heard in the
United States. Some foreign airlines reject that demand.
This is <COREF ID='13' REF='7'>the third effort</COREF> to raise <COREF ID='14' REF='7'>the $75,000 limit</COREF> , which was
set in 1966 and which all parties agree is now far too low. Efforts
in <COREF ID='X54'>1977 and 1988</COREF> would have raised <COREF ID='15' REF='7'>the limit</COREF> several-fold and were
eagerly supported by U.S. officials, but the <COREF ID='17' REF='X54'>United States</COREF> did not
approve <COREF ID='18' REF='7'>them</COREF> . Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too
low, and aircraft manufacturers feared high limits would encourage
suits against <COREF ID='19' REF='7'>them</COREF> .
``The amount of time it's taking to do something rational is
simply astonishing,'' said Jeffrey N. Shane, <COREF ID='20' REF='8'>an aviation lawyer</COREF> who
was assistant secretary of transportation for policy and
international affairs from 1989 to 1993. <COREF ID='22' REF='7'>The Warsaw Convention</COREF> , initiated in 1929 among 29 countries and
joined by the <COREF ID='23' REF='17'>United States</COREF> in 1934, also governs who may sue and
where, and details cargo rules. All nations with commercial
airlines have signed on, but <COREF ID='24' REF='X11'>the airlines</COREF> agree that <COREF ID='25' REF='7'>the document</COREF>
needs to be updated.
Because of <COREF ID='26' REF='7'>the low liability limit</COREF> , <COREF ID='X103'>many airlines</COREF> are
voluntarily paying more, either to spare <COREF ID='27' REF='X103'>themselves</COREF> a lengthy trial
at which <COREF ID='X108'>families</COREF> will try to show negligence @amp;MD; which allows higher
damages @amp;MD; or for general good will, or because <COREF ID='28' REF='7'>they</COREF> do not think
the limits will hold up in court.
American Airlines, for example, has told <COREF ID='X119'>families</COREF> of the people
who died when one of <COREF ID='29' REF='X119'>its</COREF> planes crashed in Colombia in December
that <COREF ID='30' REF='29'>it</COREF> would negotiate as if <COREF ID='31' REF='7'>the limit</COREF> did not exist; <COREF ID='32' REF='29'>it</COREF> is doing
the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on
the American Eagle commuter flight that crashed in Roselawn, Ind.,
in October 1994.
``The message <COREF ID='33' REF='X39'>American</COREF> is sending is, `We'll do what's fair,
because we know a jury will do what's fairer,''' said Barry Lambert
Harris, who was <COREF ID='34' REF='7'>an acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Bush administration</COREF> .
But <COREF ID='35' REF='X11'>the airlines</COREF> would like a realistic limit and uniform
system. Representatives of <COREF ID='36' REF='X11'>airlines</COREF> from around the world met this
week in Montreal to try to work out the details of a system with no
limits. U.S. airlines have received an antitrust exemption to
negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to government
approval. <COREF ID='38' REF='X11'>The airlines</COREF> and <COREF ID='39' REF='X36'>U.S. officials</COREF> envision fairly simple
<COREF ID='X177'>negotiations</COREF> with <COREF ID='41' REF='X108'>families</COREF> over ``economic damages,'' <COREF ID='42' REF='7'>the amount</COREF>
that the victim was likely to have earned over the remaining years of his or her life, given normal life expectancy. The sticking
<COREF ID='X189'>point</COREF> now is which court would resolve disputes if <COREF ID='47' REF='X177'>negotiations</COREF> failed.
Under <COREF ID='48' REF='7'>the current agreement</COREF> , <COREF ID='49' REF='X189'>survivors</COREF> can bring suit in the
country the plane was flying to, the home country of the airline, a
country where <COREF ID='51' REF='X11'>the airline</COREF> has <COREF ID='52' REF='29'>its</COREF> major operation or the country
where the contract for transportation was written.
The <COREF ID='53' REF='17'>United States</COREF> wants a ``fifth jurisdiction'' for <COREF ID='54' REF='X39'>Americans</COREF> :
the <COREF ID='55' REF='17'>United States</COREF> . Since <COREF ID='56' REF='53'>domestic carriers</COREF> are based <COREF ID='57' REF='53'>here</COREF> , <COREF ID='58' REF='7'>they</COREF> can
already be sued <COREF ID='59' REF='57'>here</COREF> ; adding <COREF ID='60' REF='7'>the ``fifth jurisdiction''</COREF> would
generally affect overseas carriers.

Washington, <COREF ID='6' REF='6'>Feb. 22</COREF> ( <COREF ID='7' REF='X23'>Bloomberg</COREF> ) -- <COREF ID='X25'>The Navy</COREF> ordered <COREF ID='8' REF='X15'>its Northrop Grumman Corp. F-14s</COREF> out of the skies for three days while <COREF ID='11' REF='6'>it</COREF>
investigates <COREF ID='12' REF='X15'>three recent F-14 crashes</COREF> .
The action came after an F-14A fighter crashed <COREF ID='14' REF='14'>today</COREF> in the
Persian Gulf. The two crew members ejected and were rescued and
returned to the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz with minor injuries,
the <COREF ID='15' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> said.
Sunday, an F-14D crashed into the Pacific Ocean off southern
California, killing <COREF ID='16' REF='8'>its</COREF> two crew members. And on Jan. 29, an F-14A
crashed into houses in Nashville, Tennessee, after takeoff, killing
the two crew members and three people on the ground.
The cause of <COREF ID='17' REF='14'>today</COREF> 's crash is undetermined.
``In light of <COREF ID='18' REF='X13'>the recent mishaps involving F-14As and Ds</COREF> , the <COREF ID='19' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> has ordered a 72-hour safety standdown for <COREF ID='21' REF='X15'>all F-14 aircraft</COREF> ,'' said Lt. Greg Geisen, <COREF ID='22' REF='X25'>a Navy spokesman</COREF> at the Pentagon.
``Although different models of the F-14 have been involved in <COREF ID='25' REF='X25'>these mishaps</COREF> , it is prudent to temporarily suspend routine flight
operations for <COREF ID='26' REF='X15'>all F-14s</COREF> in order to assess the available
information and determine if procedural or other modifications to <COREF ID='27' REF='X15'>F-14</COREF> operations are warranted,'' the <COREF ID='28' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> said.
A one-time exception to <COREF ID='29' REF='X25'>the standdown</COREF> will be allowed for 14
F-14s on board the USS America, which is returning to the United
States from the <COREF ID='31' REF='31'>Persian Gulf</COREF> and Bosnia, <COREF ID='32' REF='32'>Geisen</COREF> said. <COREF ID='33' REF='X25'>Those planes</COREF>
will be permitted to fly to Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia, as <COREF ID='X122'>the ship</COREF> nears port. <COREF ID='35' REF='X15'>The F14 ``Tomcat''</COREF> is <COREF ID='36' REF='X25'>the Navy's first-line fighter aircraft</COREF> . <COREF ID='38' REF='X122'>It</COREF>
has two-engines and is capable of action in all weather, day or night. The <COREF ID='39' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> has <COREF ID='40' REF='X15'>about 330 F-14s</COREF> in three models, As, Bs and Ds.
The models differ mainly in engines and avionics. The A model
uses engines from Pratt @amp; Whitney, <COREF ID='43' REF='11'>a unit</COREF> of United Technologies
Corp. The B and D models use General Electric engines.
The <COREF ID='44' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> said there have been F-14 32 crashes since 1991. <COREF ID='46' REF='46'>That figure</COREF> isn't uncommon for <COREF ID='47' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> jet fighter aircraft, <COREF ID='48' REF='32'>Geisen</COREF> said. <COREF ID='49' REF='X25'>The aircraft</COREF> was introduced to the fleet in the mid 1970s, and
has undergone several upgrades since <COREF ID='50' REF='X25'>then</COREF> , <COREF ID='51' REF='32'>Geisen</COREF> said. <COREF ID='52' REF='X25'>The planes</COREF>
were made by Grumman Corp., <COREF ID='54' REF='X15'>now Northrop Grumman</COREF> , principally in
Calverton, New York, on Long Island. <COREF ID='55' REF='X25'>The company</COREF> delivered the last
F-14 to the <COREF ID='56' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> in 1992, said Northrop Grumman spokesman John
Vosilla. <COREF ID='58' REF='X25'>He</COREF> referred all questions about <COREF ID='59' REF='14'>today</COREF> 's crash to the <COREF ID='60' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> .
Aviation safety and engineering experts will review the data
from <COREF ID='61' REF='X25'>the three recent crashes</COREF> and are to present <COREF ID='62' REF='61'>their</COREF> findings to
the Chief of Naval Operations Mike Boorda in <COREF ID='63' REF='X25'>three days</COREF> , <COREF ID='64' REF='32'>Geisen</COREF>
said. <COREF ID='65' REF='X15'>Northrop Grumman</COREF> shares were up 3/8 to 66 1/4 at midday.

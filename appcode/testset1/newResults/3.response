<COREF ID='X2'>These curious rashes</COREF> among American school children without <COREF ID='X1'>any signs</COREF>
of systemic illness remind <COREF ID='X4'>me</COREF> of <COREF ID='X7'>a similar outbreak</COREF> with hundreds of
people in Western Berlin, Germany, during the early sixties. At this
<COREF ID='1' REF='X4'>time</COREF> <COREF ID='2' REF='X7'>I</COREF> was working as <COREF ID='X19'>a young doctor</COREF> in <COREF ID='X20'>the Department</COREF> of Infectious
Diseases in the Rudolf Virchow Hospital.
At first <COREF ID='X27'>we</COREF> had no idea concerning the etiology. Since <COREF ID='3' REF='3'>our</COREF> <COREF ID='4' REF='X20'>department</COREF>
was in charge of the management of <COREF ID='5' REF='X2'>the sick</COREF> , <COREF ID='6' REF='X4'>we</COREF> started to consider
the hypothesis of an unknown virus. To <COREF ID='7' REF='3'>our</COREF> own surprise, a
distinguished virological institute claimed to have isolated such <COREF ID='8' REF='X1'>a virus</COREF> (the details <COREF ID='9' REF='X7'>I</COREF> cannot remember) from the material of some
patients.
It took about a week until <COREF ID='10' REF='X4'>we</COREF> and <COREF ID='11' REF='3'>our</COREF> colleagues from the Department
of Health found out that the disease was caused by a nutritive
allergen. A big food company had just added a new emulsifier to a
brand of margarine that was only sold in the western <COREF ID='12' REF='12'>part</COREF> of Berlin
(at <COREF ID='13' REF='X4'>that time</COREF> still separate). After <COREF ID='14' REF='13'>that lot</COREF> had been taken from the
market, <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>the problem</COREF> resolved immediately.
[Thank <COREF ID='16' REF='X19'>you</COREF> <COREF ID='17' REF='17'>Dr. Volkmer</COREF> for this very interesting and
thought-provoking account of a similar type rash illness <COREF ID='18' REF='X7'>outbreak</COREF> .
It would be of interest to know if a possible food allergen might be
the culprit in some or all of these current outbreak occurrences --
perhaps a common food preparation product distributed to schools for
use in school lunch programs. Reviewing the details of the
individual state <COREF ID='19' REF='X7'>outbreaks</COREF> , some of <COREF ID='20' REF='X2'>the outbreaks</COREF> seem to have more
of a contact dermatitis picture, suggesting an environmental
irritant, but the possibility of a common "food irritant" as
described by <COREF ID='21' REF='17'>Dr. Volkmer</COREF> remains very intriguing. We await further
information on <COREF ID='22' REF='X2'>these outbreaks</COREF> . - Mods.MPP/JW]

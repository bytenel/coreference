<COREF ID='3' REF='X12'>Eastern Airlines</COREF> executives notified union leaders that <COREF ID='X16'>the carrier</COREF> wishes to discuss selective wage reductions on <COREF ID='6' REF='3'>Feb. 3</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X22'>Union representatives</COREF> who could be reached said <COREF ID='8' REF='X16'>they</COREF> hadn't decided whether <COREF ID='9' REF='X16'>they</COREF> would respond.
By proposing <COREF ID='10' REF='X2'>a meeting date</COREF> , <COREF ID='11' REF='3'>Eastern</COREF> moved one step closer toward reopening current high-cost contract agreements with <COREF ID='12' REF='X22'>its unions</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X39'>The proposal to meet</COREF> followed an announcement Wednesday in which Philip Bakes, <COREF ID='14' REF='11'>Eastern's president</COREF> , laid out proposals to cut wages selectively an average of 29%.
<COREF ID='18' REF='X39'>The airline</COREF> 's three major labor unions, whose contracts don't expire until year's end at the earliest, have vowed to resist the <COREF ID='19' REF='18'>cuts</COREF> .
Nevertheless, one union official said <COREF ID='20' REF='18'>he</COREF> was intrigued by the brief and polite letter, which was hand-delivered by <COREF ID='X54'>corporate security officers</COREF> to <COREF ID='21' REF='12'>the unions</COREF> .
According to Robert Callahan, <COREF ID='22' REF='21'>president of Eastern's flight attendants union</COREF> , the past practice of Eastern's parent, Houston-based <COREF ID='25' REF='X2'>Texas Air Corp.</COREF> , has involved <COREF ID='X69'>confrontation and ultimatums</COREF> to <COREF ID='26' REF='21'>unions</COREF> either to accept <COREF ID='27' REF='X16'>the carrier</COREF> 's terms or to suffer the consequences -- in this case, perhaps, layoffs.
"Yesterday's performance was a departure," <COREF ID='28' REF='X69'>Mr. Callahan</COREF> said, citing the invitation to conduct broad negotiations -- and the lack of a deadline imposed by management.
"Frankly, <COREF ID='29' REF='X54'>it</COREF> 's a little mystifying."</TXT>

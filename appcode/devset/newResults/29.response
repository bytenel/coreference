<COREF ID='1' REF='X5'>Nynex Corp.</COREF> and <COREF ID='2' REF='X4'>its unions</COREF> haven't held <COREF ID='4' REF='1'>negotiations</COREF> <COREF ID='5' REF='X7'>this week</COREF> and haven't scheduled <COREF ID='6' REF='X5'>any further talks</COREF> on <COREF ID='7' REF='X11'>a new contract to end a seven-week strike</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X32'>A <COREF ID='8' REF='X32'>company</COREF> spokesman</COREF> said that <COREF ID='9' REF='6'>talks</COREF> with the Communications Workers of America and <COREF ID='X34'>the International Brotherhood</COREF> of Electrical Workers broke down last weekend.
Since then, neither side has taken steps to resume <COREF ID='12' REF='X34'>discussions</COREF> .
<COREF ID='13' REF='2'>Union</COREF> spokesmen have said that <COREF ID='14' REF='9'>talks</COREF> are stalled over a <COREF ID='15' REF='8'>company</COREF> plan to shift <COREF ID='X47'>some health-care costs</COREF> to employees.
The <COREF ID='16' REF='X47'>CWA</COREF> represents <COREF ID='X51'>about 40,000 <COREF ID='17' REF='1'>Nynex</COREF> employees</COREF> while the <COREF ID='18' REF='X51'>IBEW</COREF> represents 20,000.
In California, meanwhile, <COREF ID='19' REF='16'>CWA</COREF> members must vote by today on <COREF ID='X56'>a tentative agreement</COREF> between <COREF ID='20' REF='13'>union</COREF> and Pacific Telesis negotiators reached last month.
Officials at some <COREF ID='21' REF='20'>union</COREF> locals are recommending against the proposed contract, raising the possibility that <COREF ID='22' REF='X16'>Pac Tel</COREF> and the <COREF ID='23' REF='20'>union</COREF> will have to renegotiate parts of <COREF ID='24' REF='X56'>the agreement</COREF> .</TXT>

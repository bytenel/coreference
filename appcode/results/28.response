<COREF ID='3' REF='X4'>Boeing Co.</COREF> said <COREF ID='4' REF='3'>it</COREF> agreed to pay <COREF ID='5' REF='5'>$200,000</COREF> to settle seven civil cases brought by the Federal Aviation Administration in connection with <COREF ID='X25'>the miswiring</COREF> of fire-protection systems on its jetliners.
<COREF ID='10' REF='X25'>The fine</COREF> is <COREF ID='11' REF='X4'>the biggest ever collected from Boeing and perhaps from any airplane maker</COREF> .
In July, <COREF ID='13' REF='X25'>the FAA</COREF> proposed <COREF ID='14' REF='X2'>a $200,000 penalty</COREF> in one of the cases in which Boeing allegedly notified the agency months after it uncovered wiring problems on two aircraft.
<COREF ID='X53'>Federal regulations</COREF> require that defects be reported within 24 hours of <COREF ID='18' REF='X53'>their</COREF> discovery.
But <COREF ID='19' REF='X25'>the FAA</COREF> and <COREF ID='20' REF='X4'>Boeing</COREF> worked out a deal in which six other cases related to miswiring were included as part of a comprehensive settlement.
<COREF ID='22' REF='X25'>The FAA</COREF> said <COREF ID='23' REF='X25'>the agreement</COREF> specifies a number of corrective actions and design changes to be made by <COREF ID='24' REF='X4'>Boeing</COREF> "to ensure <COREF ID='25' REF='X25'>the miswiring conditions that are the subject of these cases</COREF> will not be repeated."
The fire-extinguishing systems have never failed in service.
In addition, <COREF ID='29' REF='X25'>the FAA</COREF> said, <COREF ID='30' REF='X4'>Boeing</COREF> has agreed to implement written procedures "to ensure appropriate and timely reporting of <COREF ID='31' REF='X8'>all defects" that could hurt safety</COREF> .</TXT>

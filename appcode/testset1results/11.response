WASHINGTON @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='5' REF='X15'>U.S. Navy</COREF> ordered <COREF ID='X34'>all of <COREF ID='6' REF='X15'>its F-14s</COREF> out of the</COREF>

skies for at least three days after <COREF ID='80' REF='X34'>one of them</COREF> crashed on <COREF ID='X45'>Thursday</COREF>

in the Persian Gulf, <COREF ID='10' REF='X3'>the third crash</COREF> of <COREF ID='X50'>an F-14</COREF> in the last month.

The two-man crew survived <COREF ID='11' REF='X3'>the crash</COREF> , ejecting into the northern

waters of <COREF ID='12' REF='X34'>the gulf</COREF> , and were rescued and returned to the carrier

Nimitz. <COREF ID='13' REF='X34'>The two crewmen</COREF> , who were not identified, were reported to have

suffered minor injuries.

The three-day shutdown of <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>the Navy's fleet of more than 330 F-14s</COREF> was ordered by the chief of naval operations, <COREF ID='18' REF='X24'>Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda</COREF> , who said in an interview at the Pentagon that while there

was no immediate evidence of a connection among <COREF ID='19' REF='X34'>the three crashes</COREF> ,

``This is <COREF ID='20' REF='X50'>an airplane</COREF> that <COREF ID='21' REF='20'>we</COREF> worry about.''

`` <COREF ID='22' REF='X2'>A jinxed airplane</COREF> ?'' <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>he</COREF> said. ``No. But known deficiencies in

the earlier models? Yes, and <COREF ID='24' REF='21'>we</COREF> 're working on that, including some

<COREF ID='X101'>changes</COREF> to <COREF ID='25' REF='X34'>the aircraft</COREF> .'' <COREF ID='26' REF='X101'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='27' REF='X34'>the three-day review</COREF> might result in new restrictions on

use of <COREF ID='29' REF='X34'>the plane</COREF> , nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest

accident rate for jet fighters in the <COREF ID='31' REF='X15'>Navy</COREF> fleet. Ten F-14s have

gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991. Each plane

costs more than $30 million.

`` <COREF ID='32' REF='21'>We</COREF> may come out with some more operational restrictions, but

it's way too early to say that,'' <COREF ID='33' REF='X34'>the admiral</COREF> said. ``This is too

serious a business to be guessing about.''

Navy officials said that during <COREF ID='35' REF='X34'>the shutdown</COREF> , special engineers

and other safety experts would review the evidence available from <COREF ID='36' REF='X34'>the three recent crashes</COREF> and inspect the rest of <COREF ID='37' REF='X34'>the fleet</COREF> for

<COREF ID='X148'>defects</COREF> in <COREF ID='38' REF='X34'>the planes</COREF> , in <COREF ID='39' REF='X148'>their</COREF> maintenance, or in pilot training. <COREF ID='40' REF='X34'>Earlier models of the fighter</COREF> , called the F-14A, were plagued

with engine problems when <COREF ID='43' REF='43'>they</COREF> entered the <COREF ID='44' REF='X15'>Navy</COREF> 's fleet of

carrier-based jet fighters in 1973. Specifically, the engines used

on <COREF ID='45' REF='X34'>the first model</COREF> were not powerful enough for <COREF ID='46' REF='X2'>a fighter</COREF> of <COREF ID='47' REF='X15'>its</COREF>

size.

The <COREF ID='48' REF='X15'>Navy</COREF> was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots

could operate <COREF ID='49' REF='X34'>the aircraft</COREF> , and had to replace many of <COREF ID='50' REF='X34'>the engines</COREF> .

Two of the three planes that have crashed since late January were <COREF ID='52' REF='52'>F-14As</COREF> .

The engines installed in later models, <COREF ID='53' REF='X34'>the F-14B and the F-14D</COREF> ,

were more powerful and have proved more reliable. Despite the

troubles of <COREF ID='54' REF='X15'>the F-14 fleet</COREF> , the rate of accidents among all <COREF ID='55' REF='X15'>Navy</COREF>

fighter planes has come down dramatically in recent years, a record

that has made <COREF ID='56' REF='X34'>the recent spate of crashes</COREF> all the more alarming.

In the first of <COREF ID='57' REF='X19'>the crashes this year</COREF> , an F-14A crashed into a

residential neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 29, seconds

after takeoff. The two-man crew was killed, along with three people

on the ground. The pilot was involved in another <COREF ID='58' REF='X15'>F-14</COREF> crash in

1995.

Last Sunday, the crew of an F-14D was killed when <COREF ID='59' REF='X34'>the fighter</COREF>

plunged into the Pacific off the coast of Southern California

during exercises. <COREF ID='60' REF='X15'>The F-14</COREF> that crashed on <COREF ID='90' REF='X45'>Thursday</COREF> had flown from <COREF ID='62' REF='X34'>the Nimitz</COREF> ,

which is sailing in <COREF ID='63' REF='X34'>the Persian Gulf</COREF> to enforce a no-fly zone over

southern Iraq, an operation that dates from the end of the 1991 war

in <COREF ID='64' REF='X34'>the gulf</COREF> . <COREF ID='65' REF='X15'>Navy officials</COREF> said that <COREF ID='67' REF='X34'>the plane</COREF> was on a routine

training mission. <COREF ID='68' REF='43'>They</COREF> would not speculate on the cause of <COREF ID='69' REF='X3'>the crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='70' REF='X34'>The plane</COREF> , which was manufacutred by the Grumman Corp. of Long

Island, has gone out of production, and the <COREF ID='71' REF='X15'>Navy</COREF> has begun to phase

out <COREF ID='72' REF='X34'>the plane</COREF> entirely, replacing <COREF ID='73' REF='71'>it</COREF> with the F-18.

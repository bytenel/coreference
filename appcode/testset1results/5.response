It is now broadly accepted that <COREF ID='X2'>virulent APMV-1 viruses</COREF> generally arise in

<COREF ID='X3'>poultry by mutation of viruses of low virulence</COREF> after these <COREF ID='1' REF='X2'>viruses</COREF> have

been introduced into <COREF ID='2' REF='X3'>poultry</COREF> flocks (Alexander DJ, British Poultry Science

42, 5-22, 2001). Since <COREF ID='X18'>this ND virus</COREF> reported from <COREF ID='X19'>Victoria</COREF> is almost

identical to <COREF ID='X21'>the 1999</COREF> Mangrove Mountain isolate, then it appears more than

a remote probability that <COREF ID='X29'>the same precursor virus</COREF> (so-called Peat's Ridge

<COREF ID='3' REF='3'>strain</COREF> ) may have been present in these Victorian <COREF ID='4' REF='4'>flocks</COREF> for some time and a

very similar <COREF ID='5' REF='X3'>mutation</COREF> event has resulted in this virulent <COREF ID='6' REF='X2'>virus</COREF> . This

raises further questions regarding the distribution of such precursor

viruses in Australia.

For countries or regions claiming <COREF ID='7' REF='X18'>ND</COREF> freedom, this outbreak again

underlines the need for continuous serosurveillance of <COREF ID='8' REF='X3'>poultry</COREF> <COREF ID='9' REF='4'>flocks</COREF> with

immediate epidemiological investigation (including attempts to isolate and

classify any <COREF ID='10' REF='X2'>APMV-1</COREF> viruses circulating) at the first sign of

seroconversion in <COREF ID='11' REF='4'>flocks</COREF> .

[ <COREF ID='12' REF='12'>Newcastle disease</COREF> virus is a notoriously variable <COREF ID='13' REF='X2'>virus</COREF> . Strains of

<COREF ID='14' REF='12'>Newcastle disease</COREF> <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>virus</COREF> differ widely in <COREF ID='50' REF='X3'>virulence</COREF> , depending on the

<COREF ID='X76'>cleavability and activation of <COREF ID='16' REF='X21'>their</COREF> hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion</COREF>

membrane proteins. Avirulent strains produce inactive precursor <COREF ID='17' REF='17'>proteins</COREF> ,

whereas in virulent strains the precursor <COREF ID='18' REF='17'>proteins</COREF> are cleaved and

activated readily. Since the spread of infection is dependent on cleavage

occurring in <COREF ID='X88'>the same tissue</COREF> in which replication occurs, the presence of

specific cellular proteases as well as the inherent <COREF ID='19' REF='X76'>cleavability</COREF> of the

surface glycoprotein <COREF ID='20' REF='X29'>precursors</COREF> determines the <COREF ID='21' REF='X88'>tissue</COREF> tropism of virus

<COREF ID='22' REF='3'>strains</COREF> and <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>their</COREF> ability to spread rapidly. This is the <COREF ID='24' REF='24'>basis</COREF> for the

definition of <COREF ID='25' REF='3'>strains</COREF> of <COREF ID='26' REF='12'>Newcastle disease</COREF> <COREF ID='27' REF='X2'>virus</COREF> as velogenic (or

viscerotropic), mesogenic, or lentogenic for <COREF ID='28' REF='3'>strains</COREF> of high, intermediate,

or low <COREF ID='29' REF='X3'>virulence</COREF> , respectively. A consequence of <COREF ID='30' REF='X18'>this</COREF> is that the number of

mutational steps between avirulence and high <COREF ID='51' REF='X3'>virulence</COREF> may be quite small,

and as Howard Pharo suggests, <COREF ID='31' REF='3'>strains</COREF> of high <COREF ID='32' REF='X3'>virulence</COREF> could potentially

arise independently from the same (or a closely related) precursor <COREF ID='33' REF='X2'>virus</COREF> of

low virulence. Consequently, this should be taken into consideration in any

disease surveillance programme. A possible complicating factor, however, is

that the source of the precursor <COREF ID='34' REF='X2'>viruses</COREF> may not be domestic <COREF ID='35' REF='X3'>poultry</COREF> . - Mod.CP]

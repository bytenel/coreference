HALF MOON BAY, Calif. <COREF ID='6' REF='2'>Joe Reid</COREF> , who died Thursday when the

<COREF ID='X27'>airplane <COREF ID='53' REF='X13'>he</COREF> was flying with 7-year-old Jessica Dubroff and her</COREF>

father crashed in Cheyenne, Wyo., took up flying <COREF ID='X35'>the same way</COREF> <COREF ID='10' REF='X35'>he</COREF>

did anything else: with passion and attention to detail.

``I respected <COREF ID='11' REF='11'>his</COREF> leadership, <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>his</COREF> thoroughness,'' said Gary

Petersen, <COREF ID='13' REF='13'>manager</COREF> of Half Moon Bay Airport. `` <COREF ID='15' REF='13'>He</COREF> was always capable

and competent, <COREF ID='16' REF='X2'>a real by-the-book guy</COREF> @amp;MD; very thorough, very

detailed.'' <COREF ID='17' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> , 52, who for nearly 27 years was <COREF ID='18' REF='X2'>a broker at the Dean Witter Reynolds office in Palo Alto</COREF> , was <COREF ID='19' REF='X13'>president of the Half Moon Bay Pilots Association</COREF> .

George Auld, <COREF ID='20' REF='X2'>a longtime friend</COREF> who co-owned the aircraft that

crashed, said <COREF ID='22' REF='X13'>he</COREF> had first taken <COREF ID='23' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> up in <COREF ID='X81'>a small plane</COREF> in 1970. <COREF ID='24' REF='X81'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='25' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> , <COREF ID='26' REF='X2'>a Vietnam veteran</COREF> , got <COREF ID='27' REF='X81'>his</COREF> pilot's license in the

late 1970s and was certified to be <COREF ID='28' REF='3'>an instructor</COREF> about four years

ago.

<COREF ID='X96'>They</COREF> bought <COREF ID='29' REF='X13'>the plane</COREF> , <COREF ID='30' REF='X2'>a 1975 single-engine Cessna 177B Cardinal</COREF> , about nine years ago.

`` <COREF ID='31' REF='X13'>He</COREF> loved <COREF ID='32' REF='X27'>flying</COREF> and helping other people learn the excitement

of <COREF ID='33' REF='X27'>flying</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='34' REF='34'>Auld</COREF> said. `` <COREF ID='35' REF='4'>Joe</COREF> 's not the type to do anything half

way.'' <COREF ID='36' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> began giving lessons to <COREF ID='37' REF='X27'>Jessica</COREF> about five months ago and

was supportive of <COREF ID='38' REF='X13'>her</COREF> effort to become the youngest person ever to

make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the United States.

`` <COREF ID='39' REF='1'>I</COREF> 'm teaching <COREF ID='40' REF='39'>her</COREF> just like <COREF ID='41' REF='40'>I</COREF> would anybody else,'' <COREF ID='42' REF='41'>he</COREF> said.

``Mentally, <COREF ID='43' REF='43'>she</COREF> grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''

Forrest Storz, who also gives <COREF ID='44' REF='X27'>flying</COREF> lessons at the airport,

called <COREF ID='46' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> <COREF ID='47' REF='47'>``an exceptional, competent pilot.''</COREF> <COREF ID='48' REF='2'>Reid</COREF> , who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and was graduated from

Saint Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kan., was active in

the <COREF ID='49' REF='19'>Half Moon Bay</COREF> community and serving a fourth term on the

Coastside County Water District board. <COREF ID='50' REF='X13'>He</COREF> also was <COREF ID='51' REF='X2'>a member of the San Mateo County Airport Land Use Committee</COREF> and was <COREF ID='52' REF='X13'>chairman of the annual Half Moon Bay Fly-In and Air Show</COREF> .

He and his wife, Ana, were <COREF ID='57' REF='57'>active parishioners</COREF> at Our Lady of

the Pillar Catholic Church. <COREF ID='58' REF='X96'>They</COREF> had two sons, Christopher, 27, of

Occidental, and Matthew, 23, of Half Moon Bay.

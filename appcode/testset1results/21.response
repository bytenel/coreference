c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service <COREF ID='5' REF='X2'>A Valujet DC-9 jetliner</COREF> with <COREF ID='7' REF='X13'>109 people</COREF> aboard crashed in the <COREF ID='8' REF='X13'>Florida Everglades</COREF> shortly after <COREF ID='X31'>takeoff from Miami International</COREF>

<COREF ID='X35'>Airport</COREF> on Saturday afternoon. Aviation and rescue officials found

widely scattered debris and said <COREF ID='X40'>there</COREF> were apparently no

survivors.

Bound for Atlanta, <COREF ID='9' REF='X40'>the twin-engine aircraft</COREF> was about 30 miles

northwest of <COREF ID='70' REF='X31'>Miami airport</COREF> when the pilot reported smoke in the

cockpit, <COREF ID='X52'>a spokesman</COREF> for the Federal Aviation Administration said. <COREF ID='12' REF='X40'>The plane</COREF> was believed to be turning back to <COREF ID='13' REF='X35'>the airport</COREF> when radar

contact was lost shortly after 2 p.m.

``We believe that <COREF ID='15' REF='X40'>the aircraft</COREF> is down somewhere in the vicinity

of the <COREF ID='16' REF='X13'>Florida Everglades</COREF> ,'' the <COREF ID='17' REF='X52'>FAA spokesman</COREF> , <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>Anthony Willett</COREF> ,

said.

The cause of <COREF ID='20' REF='2'>the crash</COREF> was unclear. Valujet Airlines Inc., which

is based in <COREF ID='22' REF='22'>Atlanta</COREF> and serves 26 cities in 17 states, began

<COREF ID='X78'>operations in 1993</COREF> with an old fleet that has grown to about 50

planes. <COREF ID='23' REF='X78'>It</COREF> has experienced a number of problems, including several

aircraft that have run off runways and one that caught fire, but

never a crash.

Television pictures from helicopters flying over the <COREF ID='24' REF='X13'>Everglades</COREF>

at midafternoon showed no shattered fuselage, tail assembly or

other large sections of <COREF ID='25' REF='X40'>the plane</COREF> , only what appeared to be <COREF ID='26' REF='X31'>widely scattered pieces of whitish debris that flecked the high grasses and desolate swamps</COREF> . It was unclear how deep the water was.

The <COREF ID='27' REF='17'>FAA</COREF> said the crash site was <COREF ID='29' REF='X31'>15 miles west of Opa Locka</COREF> , or <COREF ID='30' REF='X31'>about 20 miles northwest of Miami</COREF> . But it was unclear by late

Saturday afternoon whether the precise <COREF ID='32' REF='2'>crash</COREF> site had been located.

One aerial picture showed a depression and what appeared to be

scorched earth, but rescue pilots found no clear signs of wreckage

or survivors from Valujet's Flight 592, <COREF ID='35' REF='X2'>a daily two-hour flight</COREF>

from Miami to <COREF ID='71' REF='22'>Atlanta</COREF> . <COREF ID='38' REF='2'>The crash site</COREF> appeared to be inaccessible by road. The Coast

Guard dispatched rescue helicopters and aircraft to <COREF ID='40' REF='X40'>the site</COREF> , and

airboats were being mustered to carry rescue and other emergency

personnel to <COREF ID='41' REF='X40'>the area</COREF> . <COREF ID='42' REF='2'>Valujet</COREF> said in a statement that <COREF ID='43' REF='X40'>the plane</COREF> was carrying <COREF ID='44' REF='X2'>104 passengers and a crew of five</COREF> . Earlier reports had said that as

many as 112 and as few as 90 were on board.

Valujet's fleet, said to be <COREF ID='46' REF='X13'>the oldest in the industry</COREF> , has run

into a series of problems in the last two and a half years, the

most serious being a fire on June 8 last year that destroyed a DC-9

on a runway in <COREF ID='47' REF='22'>Atlanta</COREF> .

A flight attendant was burned and six other injuries were

reported as 57 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated.

An FAA investigation in the wake of <COREF ID='49' REF='X40'>the fire</COREF> found ``a

significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being

hired by <COREF ID='50' REF='2'>Valujet</COREF> as well as other positions, such as mechanics and

dispatchers.'' <COREF ID='51' REF='X40'>The inquiry</COREF> said <COREF ID='52' REF='2'>Valujet</COREF> 's rapid expansion from two to 48 planes

had been accompanied by accidents and incidents involving

inexperienced pilots, inadequate maintenance and insufficiently

trained flight attendants.

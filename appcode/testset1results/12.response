SEATTLE @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='5' REF='5'>National Transportation Safety Board</COREF> is borrowing <COREF ID='6' REF='X2'>a Boeing 737</COREF> from Seattle's Museum of <COREF ID='X27'>Flight</COREF> as part of <COREF ID='9' REF='9'>its investigation</COREF> into why <COREF ID='X31'>a similar jetliner</COREF> crashed near <COREF ID='X32'>Pittsburgh</COREF>

in 1994. <COREF ID='11' REF='11'>The museum's aircraft</COREF> , ironically enough, was donated by USAir,

which operated <COREF ID='13' REF='11'>the airplane that crashed</COREF> , killing 132 people on

board. <COREF ID='14' REF='5'>The board</COREF> is testing the plane's rudder controls to learn why <COREF ID='16' REF='X27'>Flight 427</COREF> suddenly rolled and crashed while on <COREF ID='17' REF='9'>its</COREF> approach to the <COREF ID='18' REF='X32'>Pittsburgh</COREF> airport Sept. 8, 1994. <COREF ID='X52'>Aviation safety investigators</COREF> say

a sharp movement of the rudder @amp;MD; <COREF ID='19' REF='X15'>the movable vertical piece in the plane's tail</COREF> @amp;MD; could have caused <COREF ID='21' REF='X31'>the jet</COREF> 's deadly roll.

<COREF ID='X67'>NTSB Chairman Jim Hall</COREF> is to address a briefing on the <COREF ID='23' REF='9'>investigation</COREF> in <COREF ID='24' REF='X17'>Seattle</COREF> Thursday, but <COREF ID='X73'>board spokesman Mike Benson</COREF>

said <COREF ID='26' REF='X67'>Hall</COREF> isn't expected to announce any findings. <COREF ID='27' REF='X73'>Benson</COREF> said <COREF ID='28' REF='X52'>investigators</COREF> are simulating <COREF ID='X77'>air loads</COREF> on <COREF ID='29' REF='11'>the 737's rudder</COREF> . ``It's a slow, methodical job since <COREF ID='31' REF='X77'>we</COREF> don't have adequate

black boxes,'' <COREF ID='32' REF='11'>he</COREF> said.

Newer models of flight data recorders, or ``black boxes,'' would

record the angle of the rudder and the pedal controlling it. But

because <COREF ID='37' REF='11'>the plane</COREF> was reduced to debris by the force of <COREF ID='38' REF='X3'>the crash</COREF> ,

and <COREF ID='39' REF='X12'>the 737</COREF> was equipped with older-model flight recorders that

didn't measure <COREF ID='40' REF='40'>such information</COREF> , <COREF ID='41' REF='X52'>investigators</COREF> are running tests to

``surmise'' <COREF ID='42' REF='29'>rudder and pedal position</COREF> , <COREF ID='43' REF='X73'>Benson</COREF> said.

Installation of <COREF ID='44' REF='X27'>improved flight recorders</COREF> was an official

recommendation of <COREF ID='45' REF='5'>the board</COREF> after earlier hearings into the <COREF ID='46' REF='X3'>Pittsburgh crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='48' REF='X27'>Museum of Flight</COREF> spokesman Bill Hayes said <COREF ID='49' REF='11'>the plane</COREF> , donated

last September, was to be partially dismantled as an exhibit. The <COREF ID='50' REF='X3'>NTSB</COREF> was looking for <COREF ID='51' REF='5'>an intact plane on which to conduct tests</COREF> , so <COREF ID='53' REF='11'>the museum</COREF> delayed <COREF ID='54' REF='9'>its</COREF> plans. <COREF ID='55' REF='11'>The tests</COREF> are being conducted at a Boeing hangar at Boeing

Field. No airborne tests are planned.

The <COREF ID='57' REF='X3'>NTSB</COREF> also conducted tests <COREF ID='58' REF='58'>last September</COREF> to determine if

wake turbulence from another plane could have contributed to <COREF ID='59' REF='X3'>the crash</COREF> . <COREF ID='60' REF='X73'>Benson</COREF> said those results are still being analyzed.

<COREF ID='X1'>These curious rashes</COREF> among <COREF ID='X2'>American school children</COREF> without any signs

of systemic illness remind <COREF ID='X5'>me of a similar outbreak with hundreds of</COREF>

people in Western Berlin, Germany, during the early sixties. At this

<COREF ID='1' REF='1'>time</COREF> <COREF ID='2' REF='1'>I</COREF> was working as <COREF ID='X20'>a young doctor in the Department of Infectious</COREF>

Diseases in the Rudolf Virchow Hospital.

At first we had <COREF ID='X30'>no idea</COREF> concerning the etiology. Since <COREF ID='3' REF='X30'>our</COREF> <COREF ID='4' REF='X20'>department</COREF>

was in charge of <COREF ID='X36'>the management</COREF> of <COREF ID='5' REF='X1'>the sick</COREF> , <COREF ID='6' REF='X36'>we</COREF> started to consider

<COREF ID='X39'>the hypothesis</COREF> of an unknown virus. To <COREF ID='7' REF='X39'>our</COREF> own surprise, a

<COREF ID='X44'>distinguished virological institute</COREF> claimed to have isolated such <COREF ID='8' REF='X1'>a virus</COREF> (the details <COREF ID='9' REF='X44'>I</COREF> cannot remember) from the material of some

patients.

It took <COREF ID='X55'>about a week</COREF> until <COREF ID='10' REF='X55'>we</COREF> and <COREF ID='11' REF='X55'>our</COREF> colleagues from the Department

of <COREF ID='X60'>Health found out that the disease was caused by a nutritive</COREF>

allergen. A big food company had just added a new emulsifier to a

brand of margarine that was only sold in the western <COREF ID='12' REF='X20'>part</COREF> of Berlin

(at <COREF ID='13' REF='1'>that time</COREF> still separate). After <COREF ID='14' REF='X60'>that lot</COREF> had been taken from the

market, <COREF ID='15' REF='X1'>the problem</COREF> resolved immediately.

[Thank <COREF ID='16' REF='X20'>you</COREF> <COREF ID='17' REF='X2'>Dr. Volkmer</COREF> for this very interesting and

thought-provoking account of a similar type rash illness <COREF ID='18' REF='X5'>outbreak</COREF> .

It would be of interest to know if a possible food allergen might be

the culprit in some or all of these current outbreak occurrences --

perhaps a common food preparation product distributed to schools for

use in school lunch programs. Reviewing the details of the

individual state <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>outbreaks</COREF> , some of <COREF ID='20' REF='X1'>the outbreaks</COREF> seem to have more

of a contact dermatitis picture, suggesting an environmental

irritant, but the possibility of a common "food irritant" as

described by <COREF ID='21' REF='X2'>Dr. Volkmer</COREF> remains very intriguing. We await further

information on <COREF ID='22' REF='X1'>these outbreaks</COREF> . - Mods.MPP/JW]

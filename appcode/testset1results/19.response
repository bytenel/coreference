Providence, Rhode Island, <COREF ID='9' REF='X4'>April 24</COREF> ( <COREF ID='10' REF='X18'>Bloomberg</COREF> ) -- <COREF ID='11' REF='X3'>Textron Inc.</COREF>

is discussing <COREF ID='12' REF='12'>the sale</COREF> of <COREF ID='X30'>its Paul Revere Corp. disability</COREF>

insurance unit to Provident Cos. Inc. for about $1 billion, a

person familiar with <COREF ID='17' REF='12'>the talks</COREF> said. <COREF ID='18' REF='12'>The talks</COREF> are part of <COREF ID='19' REF='X3'>Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron</COREF> 's

efforts to shed <COREF ID='X44'>financial services units</COREF> and focus on core

manufacturing businesses, which include making Cessna aircraft,

Bell helicopters and E-Z-GO golf carts.

For <COREF ID='22' REF='X3'>Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Provident</COREF> , an acquisition would

be <COREF ID='23' REF='X12'>the latest step in the company's effort to reorganize and expand</COREF>

through insuring policyholders against <COREF ID='X61'>loss of income</COREF> if <COREF ID='24' REF='X61'>they</COREF>

suffer a debilitating accident or illness.

Textron Chief Financial Officer Stephen Key declined to comment

on <COREF ID='X68'>the likelihood</COREF> of selling Paul Revere. <COREF ID='27' REF='23'>His company</COREF> ``has been

saying all along'' that <COREF ID='29' REF='X68'>it</COREF> plans to reduce <COREF ID='30' REF='X30'>its</COREF> presence in <COREF ID='31' REF='X44'>financial services</COREF> , <COREF ID='32' REF='31'>he</COREF> said, declining to elaborate. <COREF ID='33' REF='X3'>Provident</COREF> wouldn't comment on any potential acquisitions. <COREF ID='34' REF='X3'>Provident</COREF> Vice President Thomas White said, `` <COREF ID='35' REF='34'>We</COREF> have said it is <COREF ID='36' REF='35'>our</COREF> strategy to grow <COREF ID='37' REF='X3'>Provident</COREF> .''

News of <COREF ID='38' REF='12'>the talks</COREF> was reported in <COREF ID='39' REF='39'>today</COREF> 's Wall Street Journal. <COREF ID='40' REF='X3'>Provident</COREF> stock fell 1/8 to 30 7/8 in early trading. <COREF ID='41' REF='X3'>Textron</COREF> shares

rose 3/4 to 88 7/8.

Officials at <COREF ID='42' REF='X12'>Paul Revere</COREF> weren't available for comment. <COREF ID='43' REF='X30'>Its</COREF>

shares rose 3/4 to 25.

Worcester, Massachusetts-based <COREF ID='44' REF='X12'>Paul Revere</COREF> , 83 percent owned by <COREF ID='80' REF='X3'>Textron</COREF> , has been <COREF ID='47' REF='X2'>a laggard among Textron's six operating units</COREF> ,

and especially among <COREF ID='49' REF='X30'>its</COREF> finance-oriented businesses. In 1995,

revenue at <COREF ID='50' REF='X12'>Paul Revere</COREF> rose 14 percent to <COREF ID='51' REF='51'>$1.52 billion</COREF> while

operating income dropped 6 percent to <COREF ID='52' REF='52'>$123 million</COREF> . Revenue also

rose as income declined in 1994.

While <COREF ID='53' REF='X12'>Paul Revere</COREF> has had trouble with rising benefit costs,

results are just the opposite at Textron's Avco Financial Services

unit, <COREF ID='55' REF='X2'>a consumer finance company</COREF> , and Textron Financial Corp., <COREF ID='56' REF='X2'>a commercial finance company.</COREF>

Revenue in Avco and Textron Financial rose 19 percent <COREF ID='59' REF='59'>last year</COREF>

on a combined basis to <COREF ID='60' REF='51'>$1.99 billion</COREF> , with operating income

increasing 10 percent to <COREF ID='61' REF='52'>$365 million</COREF> .

Given the performance at <COREF ID='62' REF='X12'>Paul Revere</COREF> , Salomon Brothers analyst

George Shapiro said <COREF ID='63' REF='X3'>Textron</COREF> has been looking ``to extricate'' <COREF ID='64' REF='64'>itself</COREF> from <COREF ID='65' REF='12'>the insurance company</COREF> in favor of acquiring more <COREF ID='66' REF='66'>manufacturing businesses</COREF> .

c.1996 <COREF ID='X19'>N.Y. Times News Service</COREF>

STRATFORD, Conn. @amp;MD; <COREF ID='5' REF='1'>A helicopter</COREF> making <COREF ID='X27'>a test flight</COREF> before <COREF ID='6' REF='X19'>it</COREF>

was to be delivered to <COREF ID='X29'>the Marine Corps</COREF> to provide cargo service

for <COREF ID='X32'>the White House</COREF> appeared to lose <COREF ID='X33'>its rotors</COREF> on Thursday and

crashed onto the flight field of the Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,

killing <COREF ID='8' REF='5'>all four crew members</COREF> .

Hovering at the height of the nearby Sikorsky Bridge, where <COREF ID='X41'>the</COREF>

Merritt Parkway crosses the Housatonic River, <COREF ID='9' REF='1'>the CH53E helicopter</COREF>

@amp;MD; also known as <COREF ID='10' REF='X29'>the Super Stallion</COREF> for <COREF ID='11' REF='6'>its</COREF> size and power @amp;MD;

appeared to be in distress, <COREF ID='X58'>witnesses</COREF> said, with <COREF ID='X60'>smoke</COREF> issuing from <COREF ID='12' REF='10'>it</COREF> before <COREF ID='13' REF='6'>its 40-foot rotors</COREF> broke off.

`` <COREF ID='15' REF='1'>The helicopter</COREF> was up in the air; it's normal for <COREF ID='X66'>us</COREF> to see <COREF ID='16' REF='X66'>them</COREF> ,'' said John Nasufi, who spotted <COREF ID='17' REF='X58'>it</COREF> as <COREF ID='18' REF='X66'>he</COREF> was loading pizzas

from <COREF ID='19' REF='X33'>his</COREF> restaurant above <COREF ID='20' REF='X29'>the river</COREF> for a lunchtime delivery to the <COREF ID='21' REF='X41'>Sikorsky</COREF> workers. `` <COREF ID='22' REF='1'>The helicopter</COREF> had <COREF ID='23' REF='X60'>smoke</COREF> coming out, and all of

a sudden <COREF ID='24' REF='19'>it</COREF> lost <COREF ID='25' REF='6'>its blades</COREF> , and that was it. <COREF ID='27' REF='19'>It</COREF> came straight

down.''

The explosion shook nearby buildings and stopped traffic on the <COREF ID='28' REF='X41'>bridge</COREF> , from which the crushed fuselage could be seen burning on <COREF ID='29' REF='X29'>the tarmac</COREF> less than half a mile away, about 50 feet from the <COREF ID='30' REF='20'>river</COREF> . <COREF ID='31' REF='X29'>The craft's distress</COREF> had lasted long enough for one driver

to call a Bridgeport radio station to report that <COREF ID='33' REF='1'>a helicopter</COREF> was

in <COREF ID='34' REF='34'>trouble</COREF> . <COREF ID='35' REF='X41'>Sikorsky</COREF> officials said <COREF ID='36' REF='5'>all four peole on board</COREF> were <COREF ID='37' REF='37'>employees</COREF> . <COREF ID='38' REF='37'>Their</COREF> names were withheld until relatives could be notified.

A spokeswoman for Sikorsky, <COREF ID='40' REF='40'>Gina McAllister</COREF> , said <COREF ID='41' REF='1'>the heavy-lift helicopter</COREF> , which can carry a payload of 31 tons, was to be

assigned to the <COREF ID='42' REF='X29'>Marine</COREF> base at Quantico, Va. <COREF ID='43' REF='1'>The helicopter</COREF> would

have been used to ferry <COREF ID='X131'>limousines and other advance equipment</COREF> for

<COREF ID='X135'>the <COREF ID='44' REF='X32'>White House</COREF> .</COREF> <COREF ID='45' REF='X135'>She</COREF> said <COREF ID='46' REF='X131'>it</COREF> would not have carried the president. <COREF ID='47' REF='2'>The crash</COREF> occurred at 11:08 a.m. <COREF ID='48' REF='X58'>Witnesses</COREF> differed as to

whether <COREF ID='49' REF='X29'>the craft</COREF> had burst into flames before <COREF ID='50' REF='X135'>it</COREF> dropped onto <COREF ID='51' REF='X27'>the flight field</COREF> , or upon impact. But many said that before <COREF ID='52' REF='X29'>the craft</COREF>

fell, <COREF ID='53' REF='6'>its three rotor blades</COREF> shot off. One landed across the <COREF ID='55' REF='20'>Housatonic River</COREF> , which borders the <COREF ID='56' REF='X41'>Sikorsky</COREF> property, one flew

toward <COREF ID='57' REF='X29'>the Sikorsky Bridge</COREF> , and the third fell toward the assembly

plant. <COREF ID='58' REF='40'>Ms. McAllister</COREF> said the cause of <COREF ID='59' REF='2'>the crash</COREF> was not known. With

the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration and the

National Transportation Safety Board, she said, <COREF ID='60' REF='X41'>Sikorsky Aircraft</COREF>

would conduct the safety investigation with the participation of

the Navy Safety Center.

The <COREF ID='61' REF='X29'>Marine Corps</COREF> and the Navy have purchased 150 of the

heavy-lift helicopters, which can be used for amphibious assaults,

carrying cargo and recovering aircraft, according to Jane's All the

World's Aircraft. <COREF ID='62' REF='9'>CH53E's</COREF> were used to rescue Air Force Capt. Scott

O'Grady when <COREF ID='63' REF='X29'>he</COREF> was shot down over Bosnia, and to evacuate the U.S.

embassy in Somalia, <COREF ID='64' REF='40'>Ms. McAllister</COREF> said.

`` <COREF ID='65' REF='1'>This helicopter</COREF> has a very proud tradition, and the <COREF ID='66' REF='X41'>Sikorsky</COREF>

<COREF ID='X214'>family</COREF> is devastated by <COREF ID='67' REF='19'>this mishap</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='68' REF='X214'>she</COREF> said.

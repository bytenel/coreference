------------------------------------------

.

<COREF ID='X6'>A second infected <COREF ID='1' REF='X3'>area</COREF> in East Anglia</COREF> was declared free from <COREF ID='2' REF='X4'>classical swine fever</COREF> ( <COREF ID='3' REF='3'>CSF</COREF> ) today and the relevant Infected Area Order has been

revoked.

Pigs can now be freely moved on and off <COREF ID='X18'>about 160 farms</COREF> previously in <COREF ID='4' REF='X3'>the Infected Area</COREF> imposed around <COREF ID='X21'>the Norfolk breeding unit</COREF> where <COREF ID='X22'>the outbreak</COREF>

is believed to have originated. <COREF ID='5' REF='X18'>It</COREF> had been confirmed as infected on 9

<COREF ID='X29'>August - the <COREF ID='6' REF='X6'>second</COREF> of 15 premises to be confirmed with <COREF ID='7' REF='3'>CSF</COREF> following the</COREF>

start of the <COREF ID='8' REF='X22'>outbreak</COREF> on <COREF ID='9' REF='X29'>8 Aug 2000</COREF> .

The infected area in north Essex was <COREF ID='10' REF='X3'>the first</COREF> to be pronounced clear of

<COREF ID='11' REF='X3'>the disease</COREF> , and movement restrictions lifted on more than 90 farms

<COREF ID='12' REF='12'>there</COREF> , on 22 Sep 2000.

The decision to lift the infected <COREF ID='13' REF='X3'>area</COREF> was made following full veterinary

investigation. Similar investigations will be progressively undertaken in

<COREF ID='X61'>the other infected areas</COREF> with <COREF ID='X63'>a view</COREF> to lifting <COREF ID='14' REF='X63'>them</COREF> as soon as possible.

Notes for Editors

1. <COREF ID='X70'>Farmers</COREF> in the remaining infected <COREF ID='15' REF='X61'>areas</COREF> who have animal welfare

problems because of overstocking may apply for a licence to move <COREF ID='16' REF='16'>pigs</COREF>

within the same surveillance zone of an infected area, subject to strict

conditions. <COREF ID='17' REF='17'>They</COREF> can also apply to send <COREF ID='18' REF='16'>pigs</COREF> to slaughter under the Pig

Disposal (Welfare) Scheme. Details of both options are available from the

Bury St Edmunds control center helpline on <COREF ID='19' REF='19'>08702 414215</COREF> . <COREF ID='20' REF='X70'>Farmers</COREF> in

infected <COREF ID='21' REF='X61'>areas</COREF> can also phone this <COREF ID='22' REF='22'>number</COREF> for general information

relating to the <COREF ID='23' REF='X22'>outbreak</COREF> of <COREF ID='24' REF='3'>CSF</COREF> .

2. <COREF ID='X109'>An EU ban</COREF> on the export of live <COREF ID='25' REF='16'>pigs</COREF> and <COREF ID='26' REF='16'>pig</COREF> semen from <COREF ID='27' REF='X21'>Norfolk</COREF> and

Suffolk remains in place until November 15. <COREF ID='28' REF='X109'>It</COREF> will be reconsidered at

the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee of <COREF ID='29' REF='X3'>the EU</COREF> .
